  ## About
  Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant application that utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM.  Eat-Da-Burger lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Each burger has a `Devour!` button that allows the burger to be eaten and then reordered. The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
